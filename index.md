Now let's see what makes you get the most out of your career.

### What are the differences between people who come from a STEM background and those who did not?

Traditionally, many people in fields like IT tend to have a STEM background. However, there are also a lot of people having chosen another major in their education. Can this have an influence on ones career? Do people from a STEM background have it easier?

| Question | with STEM background        | without STEM background  |
|:-------------|:-------------:| :-----:|
| age started coding      | 15.302807	 | 17.896123 |
| years of coding experience      | 13.410821	      |  12.118370	 |
| years of professional coding experience | 8.538450 |  8.399191 |
| is a developer by profession | 79.86 % | 66.80 % |
| not primarily developer, but coding is part of job | 8.04 % | 17.51 % |

As we can see, people who chose a STEM background on average started coding earlier, had more coding experience and are more likely to be developer by profession. So, to become a developer, choose a STEM major.

### How to maximize your hourly wage?

There are some people working 50-60 hrs a week and make a lot of money out of that. But is it really worth it? Looking at just the salary falls short in one important point: Making 100k with, on average, 40 hrs per week is way better than working 60 hrs a week for the same salary. 

| Question |	Correlation |
|:-------------|:-------------:|
| Not coding as a hobby	| 1.156312e+14|
| Coding as a hobby | 1.156312e+14	|
| Developer by profession |	-3.379505e+13	|
| not primarily developer, but coding is part of job |	-3.379505e+13	|
| Secondary school education, no college |	-8.355474e+01	|
| Professional degree (JD, MD, etc.)| -6.428498e+01	|
| company has 2 to 9 employees| -6.234352e+01	|
| Working as Independent contractor, freelancer,... |	6.161569e+01	|
| company has 10 to 19 employees |	-6.121245e+01	|

Here are some points that I observed from training a model to predict the hourly wage:

- Coding as a hobby or not as no influence on your income
- Get a bachelor's or master's degree instead of not going to college or earning a professional degree
- Work in bigger companies
- Work independently or as a freelancer

### How does experience change the way coders handle problems?

A coder with a lot of experience in coding might have better approaches than someone relatively new to the field. Learning from more experienced members can have a huge impact on ones success. Hence, why not learn from experienced engineers and coders how to solve problems?
